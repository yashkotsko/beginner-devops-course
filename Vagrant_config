# Vagrant uses oracle virtualbox as defult hypervisor

1. Download Vagrant for Ubuntu (commands from official Vagrant site):
 curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
 sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install vagrant

2. create folder vagrant_vms
 mkdir vagrant-vms

3. Create folders inside Vagrant_vms for each vm:
 mkdir name1
 mkdir etc

4. Inside each folder (name1, etc) run command:
 vagrant init (config.vm.box), you can find this config.vm.box at https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search

5. After running "init" run command (still inside folder name1 or etc.)
 vagrant up (this command will create and run vm) 
 (and now you can see new vm in virtualbox program)

6. To connect to your new vm run (at the same dir):
 vagrant ssh (and now you are inside your vm)

7. To exit from your vm (run command inside vm): 
 vagrant exit 

8. To power off your vm (run command outside vm in folder name1, etc):
 vagrant halt

9. To destroy vm:
 vagrant destroy

10. To reboot vm:
 vagrant reload
